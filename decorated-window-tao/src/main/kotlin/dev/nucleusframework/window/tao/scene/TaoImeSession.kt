/**
 * Routes native IME callbacks into the active Compose text-input session (#595).
 *
 * Three native events, three methods:
 * - [preedit] — macOS `setMarkedText:` / `unmarkText` (empty text cancels)
 * - [commit] — `insertText:` while a composition is active, via
 *   `TextEditingScope.commitText` (replaces the composing region in one edit)
 * - [replaceCommit] — PressAndHold accent pick (delete the already-committed
 *   base letter, then commit the accented character)
 *
 * Raw key delivery while the IME owns the keyboard is decided natively
 * (`keyDown`/`keyUp` in tao's macOS view). This object does not filter keys.
